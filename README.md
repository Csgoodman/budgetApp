# Budget App
The budget application is a single page application that allows the end user to add/delete income(s) and expense(s) for a given month and understand the percentage of each expense, relative to the overall income.

## Project Details and Functionality
The purpose of this project was to create a simple budget application and enhance my JavaScript, CSS, and HTML knowledge. This project gave insight on how to utilize privacy methods within JavaScript, event bubbling and delegation, and how to efficiently store data structures. The idea for this project came from Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course.

## Using the Budget App
Download the budgetApp project and open up the index.html file. You will have the ability to add/delete income and expense items, with live updates on the percentage of each expense and the available budget for the month. NOTE - because the system is not utilizing an external database, once the page is refreshed, all data will be erased.
